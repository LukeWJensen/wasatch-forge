                        Wasatch Forge was started by two good friends with a common passion: bringing steel to life using fire as a tool.
                        Matt and Mike have sought since the beginning to share their passion with others &mdash; through the craftsmanship of their wares, the hospitality of their shop, and by sharing their knowledge with anyone and everyone.
